=head1 CONFIGURATION

    plugins:
        Swagger:
           main_api_module: MyApp
           show_ui: 1
           ui_url: /doc
           ui_dir: /path/to/files
           auto_discover_skip:
            - /swagger.json
            - qr#^/doc/#

=head2 main_api_module

If not provided explicitly, the Swagger document's title and version will be set
to the abstract and version of this module. 

Defaults to the first
module to import L<Dancer::Plugin::Swagger>.

=head2 show_ui

If C<true>, a route will be created for the Swagger UI (see L<http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/>).

Defaults to C<true>.

=head2 ui_url

Path of the swagger ui route. Will also be the prefix for all the CSS/JS dependencies of the page.

Defaults to C</doc>.

=head2 ui_dir

Filesystem path to the directory holding the assets for the Swagger UI page.

Defaults to a copy of the Swagger UI code bundled with the L<Dancer::Plugin::Swagger> distribution.

=head2 auto_discover_skip

List of urls that should not be added to the Swagger document by C<swagger_auto_discover>.
If an url begins with C<qr>, it will be compiled as a regular expression.

Defauls to C</swagger.json> and, if C<show_ui> is C<true>, all the urls under C<ui_url>.

=head1 PLUGIN KEYWORDS

=head2 swagger_path \%args, $route

    swagger_path {
        description => 'Returns info about a judge',
    },
    get '/judge/:judge_name' => sub {
        ...;
    };

Registers a route as a swagger path item in the swagger document.

=head3 Supported arguments

=over

=item method

The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc) for the path item.

Defaults to the route's method.

=item path

The url for the path item.

Defaults to the route's path.

=item description

The path item's description.

=item parameters

Parameters for the path item. 

Route parameters are automatically populated. E.g., 

    swagger_path
    get '/judge/:judge_name' => { ... };

is equivalent to

    swagger_path
        parameters => [
            { name => 'judge_name', in => 'path', required => 1, type => 'string' },
        ],
    get '/judge/:judge_name' => { ... };



=back

=head2 swagger_auto_discover skip => \@list

Populates the Swagger document with information of all
the routes of the application.

Accepts an optional C<skip> parameter that takes an arrayref of
routes that shouldn't be added to the Swagger document. The routes
can be specified as-is, or via regular expressions. If no skip list is given, defaults to 
the c<auto_discover_skip> configuration value.

    swagger_auto_discover skip => [ '/swagger.json', qr#^/doc/# ];

The information of a route won't be altered if it's 
already present in the document.

If a route has path parameters, they will be automatically
added as such in the C<parameters> section.

Routes defined as regexes are skipped, as there is no clean way
to automatically make them look nice.

        # will be picked up
    get '/user' => ...;

        # ditto, as '/user/{user_id}'
    get '/user/:user_id => ...;

        # won't be picked up
    get qr#/user/(\d+)# => ...;


Note that routes defined after C<swagger_auto_discover> has been called won't 
be added to the Swagger document. Typically, you'll want C<swagger_auto_discover>
to be called at the very end of your module. Alternatively, C<swagger_auto_discover>
can be called more than once safely -- which can be useful if an application creates
routes dynamically.
